# We Sale v2

Back in the day we have built a WeSale, voice and text recognition tool for direct sellers.
When building the product, there were almost none well supported and "battle-tested" NLP tools and models.
DialogFlow which we were using was supporting only the engilish language, so after a few years things have changed.
There is a lot of different tools and models now, so we can use for it to support our clients with enormous accuracy.

## Idea

1. Allow companies to create discussions' scenarios for sellers/marketers etc.
2. Process what does seller says with omitting the input of their client to avoid the issue of recording someone who does not want to be recorded.
3. Since we are processing any input it can be either a text or a voice (that is in the end transformed to text).

This gives us a huge flexibility:
1. We can process any texts and voice
    a. MVP will consist of text processing only to simplify
    b. Voice processing will be a v2, since transforming Voice to Text is already a technical curve to tackle
2. It can be used in various scenarios (text)
    a. emails (cold mailing, targetted mails etc.)
    b. posts (blogs, social media etc.)
    c. chatbots (to help AI tools to be more precised with communication with a human)
    d. chats (were a human is on the "other side")
3. Voice
    a. direct sellers
    b. phone calls (call centers etc.)
